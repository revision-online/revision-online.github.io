         question: "What is the difference between a step-up transformer and a step-down transformer?",
         answer: "A step-up transformer increases the voltage from the primary to the secondary coil, whereas a step-down transformer decreases the voltage from the primary to the secondary coil."

         question: "What is the difference between a geostationary satellite and a polar satellite?",
         answer: "A geostationary satellite orbits the Earth at the same rate as the Earth's rotation and stays above the same point on the equator, whereas a polar satellite orbits the Earth from north to south (or vice versa) and passes over the poles."
