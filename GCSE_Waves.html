      <h1> GCSE Physics Revision: Waves and EM Spectrum notes </h1>
    <p>Waves are disturbances that propagate through space and time, carrying energy and information without transporting matter. Waves can take many forms and are present in many different physical systems, such as water, air, electromagnetic fields, and even matter itself.</p>
    <h2>Types of Waves</h2>
    <p>There are two main types of waves: transverse waves and longitudinal waves.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Transverse waves:</b> Transverse waves are characterized by perpendicular oscillations of the medium and the direction of wave propagation. Examples of transverse waves include electromagnetic waves and water waves.</li>
      <li><b>Longitudinal waves:</b> Longitudinal waves are characterized by parallel oscillations of the medium and the direction of wave propagation. Examples of longitudinal waves include sound waves and seismic waves.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Wave Properties</h2>
    <p>Waves have several properties that describe their behavior and characteristics, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Amplitude:</b> The amplitude of a wave is the maximum displacement of the medium from its rest position. For transverse waves, this is the maximum height of the wave; for longitudinal waves, this is the maximum compression or rarefaction of the medium.</li>
      <li><b>Wavelength:</b> The wavelength of a wave is the distance between two adjacent points in the medium that are in phase. It is typically measured from crest to crest for transverse waves and from compression to compression for longitudinal waves.</li>
      <li><b>Frequency:</b> The frequency of a wave is the number of oscillations that occur in a given time interval, usually one second. It is measured in hertz (Hz).</li>
      <li><b>Period:</b> The period of a wave is the time it takes for one complete oscillation to occur. It is related to frequency by the equation: period = 1 ÷ frequency.</li>
      <li><b>Speed:</b> The speed of a wave is the distance it travels in a given time interval. It is related to wavelength and frequency by the equation: speed = wavelength × frequency.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Wave Interactions</h2>
    <p>Waves can interact with each other and with obstacles in their path, leading to phenomena such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and interference.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Reflection:</b> Reflection occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle and bounces back, changing direction but not frequency or wavelength. This is why you can see your reflection in a mirror.</li>
      <li><b>Refraction:</b> Refraction occurs when a wave passes through an interface between two media with different densities, causing the wave to change direction and speed. This is why objects can appear distorted when viewed through a curved glass surface.</li>
      <li><b>Diffraction:</b> Diffraction occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or opening that is comparable in size to its wavelength, causing the wave to bend around the obstacle or spread out through the opening. This is why you can hear sound around corners and why light can enter a dark room through a small crack in a door.</li>
      <li><b>Interference:</b> Interference occurs when two or more waves meet and interact with each other, either constructively (adding up to create a larger wave) or destructively (cancelling each other out). This is why you can hear echoes in a large room and why you can see patterns of light and dark on a screen when light waves interfere with each other.</li>
  <li><b>Kinetic energy:</b> Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. Waves with higher amplitude or frequency have more kinetic energy.</li>
  <li><b>Potential energy:</b> Potential energy is the energy stored in a system due to its configuration or position. Waves with higher amplitude or frequency have more potential energy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wave Equations</h2>
<p>There are several key equations that describe the behavior and characteristics of waves:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Wave speed:</b> Wave speed (v) is related to wavelength (λ) and frequency (f) by the equation: v = λf.</li>
  <li><b>Wave period:</b> Wave period (T) is related to frequency (f) by the equation: T = 1/f.</li>
  <li><b>Wave energy:</b> Wave energy (E) is related to wave amplitude (A) and frequency (f) by the equation: E = 1/2 × A^2 × ρ × V × f^2, where ρ is the density of the medium and V is the volume of the medium affected by the wave.</li>
  <h2>Wave Refraction and Critical Angle</h2>
  <p>When a wave travels from one medium to another, its speed and direction can change. This is called refraction.</p>
  <p>The amount of refraction depends on the angle at which the wave hits the boundary between the two mediums, as well as the difference in the wave speeds between the two mediums.</p>
  <p>The amount of refraction can be calculated using Snell's law:</p>
  <p>n1 sinθ1 = n2 sinθ2</p>
  <p>where n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two mediums, and θ1 and θ2 are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.</p>
  <p>When a wave passes from a medium with a higher refractive index to a medium with a lower refractive index, it can be totally internally reflected if the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle. The critical angle can be calculated using the equation:</p>
  <p>sinθc = n2 / n1</p>
  <p>where n1 is the refractive index of the medium the wave is coming from, and n2 is the refractive index of the medium the wave is entering.</p>
  <h2>Electromagnetic Spectrum</h2>
  <p>The electromagnetic (EM) spectrum is a range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation. It includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays.</p>
  <p>Each type of electromagnetic radiation has a different wavelength and frequency, which determines its properties and uses.</p>
  <p>Uses of electromagnetic radiation include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Communication:</b> Radio waves and microwaves are used for communication purposes, such as radio and television broadcasting and mobile phones.</li>
    <li><b>Medicine:</b> X-rays and gamma rays are used for medical imaging and cancer treatment.</li>
    <li><b>Energy:</b> Visible light is used for photosynthesis in plants, and solar energy can be converted into electricity using photovoltaic cells.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, exposure to certain types of electromagnetic radiation, such as ultraviolet radiation and X-rays, can be harmful to living organisms and can cause damage to cells and tissues.Ultraviolet radiation can cause skin cancer and damage to the eyes, while X-rays can cause mutations in DNA and increase the risk of cancer. Infrared (IR) radiation heats human tissue and exposure to high levels of gamma radiation can be fatal and cause immediate damage to the body's cells and tissues.</p>
